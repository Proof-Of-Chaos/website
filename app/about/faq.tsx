              Will you expand to other parachains?
            </h5>
            <p>
              A major focus is to decentralize the project and through this
              decentralization also demonstrate a path for any and all
              parachains to implement their own incentives programs.

              How is this project financed?
            </h5>
            <p>
              The project is financed through royalty revenues from secondary
              sales. Recently we also started to generate income through primary
              sales of some additional collections. The Kusama treasury has been
              very supportive and stepped in to help us cover our costs whenever
              we fell short with our revenues and to help us build faster.
