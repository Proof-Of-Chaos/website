</h5>
                    <p>A major focus is to decentralize the project and through this decentralization also demonstrate a path for any and all parachains to implement their own incentives programs.

</h5>
                    <p>The project is financed through royalty revenues from secondary sales. Recently we also started to generate income through primary sales of some additional collections. The Kusama treasury has been very supportive and stepped in to help us cover our costs whenever we fell short with our revenues and to help us build faster.</p>
